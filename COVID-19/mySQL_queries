/* 
Using CTE and OVER clause to estimate the rate at which COVID is spreading. According to CDC update Januart 14, 2022: 
There's "an average period of infectiousness and risk of transmission between 2-3 days before and 8 days after symptom onset."
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html)

It will be assumed that the new cases on any given day were infected by the new cases of the previous 10 days--those who were still infectious.
Truly calculating the spread requires much more complicated methods, such as a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) Model. In other words,
this is not an actual metric of spread, but is merely for exercise.
